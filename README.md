# Smart Grid Optimization Using Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning
As renewable energy sources like solar and wind become increasingly prevalent, managing their variability and ensuring grid stability presents both opportunities and challenges. This project explores the use of predictive analytics and machine learning to optimize the integration of renewable energy sources within smart grid infrastructures.It aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of modern energy systems by leveraging advanced data-driven techniques.


**Key Features:**
- Machine learning-based energy generation forecasting (solar/wind)
- Load consumption prediction for dynamic demand-response strategies
- Real-time grid monitoring and anomaly detection
- Predictive maintenance using sensor data and failure history
